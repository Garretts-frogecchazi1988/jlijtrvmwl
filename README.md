Just staggered out of the theater — wow, Plankton: The Movie is like an aquarium exploded in my brain, like, with lights and music... and that popcorn butter still sticking to my fingers. Seriously, I'm those kernels, all scattered on the floor, and my back is killing me from those seats. 

When the planktons started that underwater revolution. Imagine if a blender and a disco had a baby underwater — yes, that’s the  . The soundtrack practically buzzing in my ears. My god, stand-off with a seahorse general — did seahorses have limps before this? I swear I saw one with a limp and suddenly now it means something. Might just want to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   and see if I... really saw that.

> I swear somewhere in act two, I’m pretty sure the jellyfish were in love? Maybe? Or was that about existential dread — probably both? It’s unclear. With those colors and my thoughts just, swirling like the smoothie I dropped last week. Oh! Bobby would love it - or hate it? Must message — maybe we can 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   together next time. Oh shoot, I still have popcorn in my shoes. How did that even happen?

Nobody told me there’d be that squid flash mob scene. Optimistic, really, like an octopus who thinks it can handle eight cups of coffee at once. And all of this, while that one child kept crying... balling up my annoyance like I-97 unfolded laundry.

Wanna bet that hermit crab was noble royalty? Royalty in a tiny shell, like me trying to fit in these jeans after that cheesecake yesterday. Man, this   was like a Plankton Renaissance, with 80% confusion and 20% pure magic — splash of teeny weeny logic in there too. 

P.S.: Remember Herb said to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 it, cause we need to decipher that dialogue — translation, alien speak? Croissants!
